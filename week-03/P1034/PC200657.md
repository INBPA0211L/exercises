# Santa Claus is coming

As you might know, Santa Claus visits children on the 6th of December and rewards both nice and not-very-nice children (based on how many C programs they developed in the last year).

Write a C function that gets the three components of a valid date: the combination of the year, month, and day as integers, in this order. The function should return an integer representing how many nights we must sleep until Santa Claus visits us again! Keep in mind that there are leap years: a year is a leap year if it can be divided by `4` but cannot be divided by `100`. Additionally, years that can be divided by `400` are also considered leap years.

## Specification of the function

```c
int next_arrival(int, int, int);
```

## Remark

Place the function in file `next_arrival.c`, then submit the source file. You can test your solution using the sample input and the given `main()` function. However, the system may test your solution using another `main()` function. **Thus, submit your solution without function `main()`!**.

## `main.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
  int year, month, day;
  int next_arrival(int, int, int);
  while (scanf("%d %d %d", &year, &month, &day) != EOF)
  {
    int res = next_arrival(year, month, day);
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

## Makefile

```makefile
CC = gcc
OBJS = main.o next_arrival.o
TARGETS = main
all: $(TARGETS)
main: $(OBJS)
$(CC) $(OBJS) -o main
main.o: main.c
$(CC) -c main.c
next_arrival.o: next_arrival.c
$(CC) -c next_arrival.c
clean:
rm -rf $(OBJS) *~ $(TARGETS)
```
