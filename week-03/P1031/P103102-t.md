# `P103102-t` - Additive inverse (version special value)

## The function

Define function `change_signature`, which returns its parameter, changing its signature!


### Formal parameter list

1. `n` - value of `n` (an integer value from the range `[-100,100]`)

### Returned value

* the additive inverse of `n`

### Examples

| `n` | Returned value | 
| ---: | :-- | 
| `80` | `-80` | 
| `-81` | `81` | 
| `-36` | `36` | 
| `44` | `-44` | 

Each `' '` (space) character in a literal was replaced with a  `'·'` (dot) character.

## The `main()` function

Define a main function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each line contains a single test case. Each line contains the function's argument (`n`).
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The input is terminated with the following line (and it should not be processed): `"999"`

### Sample execution

#### Standard input

```
80
-81
-36
44
999
```

#### Standard output

```
-80
81
36
-44
```
