## The function

Define function `square_circumference`, which returns the perimeter of the square having sides with the given length!


### Formal parameter list

1. `n` - length of a side (an integer value from the range `[1,100]`)

### Returned value

* the perimeter of the square

### Examples

| `n` | Returned value | 
| ---: | :-- | 
| `8` | `32` | 
| `48` | `192` | 
| `26` | `104` | 
| `92` | `368` | 
| `4` | `16` | 
| `46` | `184` | 
| `7` | `28` | 
| `25` | `100` | 
| `65` | `260` | 
| `80` | `320` | 

Each `' '` (space) character in a literal was replaced with a  `'Â·'` (dot) character.

## The `main()` function

Define a main function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each line contains a single test case. Each line contains the function's argument (`n`).
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The end of input is denoted with `EOF`.
