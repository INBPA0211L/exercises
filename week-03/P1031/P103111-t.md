# `P103111-t` - Circumference of a circle (version special value)

## The function

Define function `circle_circumference`, which returns the circumference of a circle having sides with the radius!

### Formal parameter list

1. `r` - radius of the circle (an integer value from the range `[1, 100]`)

### Returned value

* the circumference of the circle (a real value)

### Examples

| `r` | Returned value | 
| ---: | --: | 
| `14` | `87.96459430051421` | 
| `67` | `420.97341558103227` | 
| `44` | `276.46015351590177` | 
| `6` | `37.69911184307752` | 

## The `main()` function

Define a `main()` function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each line contains a single test case. Each line contains the function's argument (`r`).
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The input is terminated with the following line (and it should not be processed):

	```
	0
	```

## Remark
The output was created using a Python script. Thus, precision errors can be different in the representation of floating values.


## Sample execution
