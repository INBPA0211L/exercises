# `P104103-t` - Count of prime elements (version special value)

## The function

Define function `count_of_primes`, which gets the memory address of an integer array and its length, then returns how many prime numbers the given array contains!

### Formal parameter list
         
1. `numbers` - the memory address of the array (type: `int *`)
1. `length` - the length of the array (type: `int`)


### Returned value

* the number of prime elements (type: `int`)

### Examples

| `numbers` | `n` | Returned value | 
| :--- | ---: | ---: | 
| `[92, 53, 25, 4, 83, 41]` | `6` | `3` |
| `[68, 9, 59, 15, 39, 55, 45, 17]` | `8` | `2` |
| `[79, 12, 65, 39, 32, 12, 68, 82, 24, 42]` | `10` | `1` |
| `[31, 81, 97]` | `3` | `2` |
| `[17, 49]` | `2` | `1` |
| `[41, 79, 38, 99, 84, 60, 25]` | `7` | `2` |

## The `main()` function

Define a `main()` function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each test case is described in a single line.
    1. The first integer in the line describes the length of the array (`length`).
    1. The next `length` number of integers are the elements of the array, in their corresponding order.
    1. Integers are separated using simple space (`' '`) characters.
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The input is terminated with the following line (and it should not be processed):

	```
	0
	```

## Sample execution

### Standard input

```

3 31 81 97
2 17 49
7 41 79 38 99 84 60 25
0
```

### Standard output

```
