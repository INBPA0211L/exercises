# `P104102-t` - Count of even elements (version special value)

## The function

Define function `count_of_evens`, which gets the memory address of an integer array and its length, then returns how many even numbers the given array contains!

### Formal parameter list
         
1. `numbers` - the memory address of the array (type: `int *`)
1. `length` - the length of the array (type: `int`)


### Returned value

* the number of even elements (type: `int`)

### Examples

| `numbers` | `n` | Returned value | 
| :--- | ---: | ---: | 
| `[70, -64]` | `2` | `2` |
| `[-51, 61, 48, -19, 64, -69, -99, -39]` | `8` | `2` |
| `[77, 95, -11, 87, 53, -38, 9, 24]` | `8` | `2` |

## The `main()` function

Define a `main()` function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each test case is described in a single line.
    1. The first integer in the line describes the length of the array (`length`).
    1. The next `length` number of integers are the elements of the array, in their corresponding order.
    1. Integers are separated using simple space (`' '`) characters.
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The input is terminated with the following line (and it should not be processed):

	```
	0
	```

## Sample execution

0
```

### Standard output
