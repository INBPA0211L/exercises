# `P104101-e` - Count of odd elements (version `EOF`)

## The function

Define function `count_of_odds`, which gets the memory address of an integer array and its length, then returns how many odd numbers the given array contains!

### Formal parameter list
         
1. `numbers` - the memory address of the array (type: `int *`)
1. `length` - the length of the array (type: `int`)


### Returned value

* the number of odd elements (type: `int`)

### Examples

| `numbers` | `n` | Returned value | 
| :--- | ---: | ---: | 
| `[-58, 21, 50, 92, 62]` | `5` | `1` |
| `[-52, -30, 29, -19, -84, 8, 31, -67]` | `8` | `4` |
| `[70, 47, -35, -89, -80]` | `5` | `3` |

## The `main()` function

Define a `main()` function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each test case is described in a single line.
    1. The first integer in the line describes the length of the array (`length`).
    1. The next `length` number of integers are the elements of the array, in their corresponding order.
    1. Integers are separated using simple space (`' '`) characters.
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The end of input is denoted with `EOF`.

## Sample execution
