# `P104110-t` - Count of increasing neighbours (version special value)

## The function

Define function `count_of_increasing_neighbours`, which gets the memory address of an integer array and its length, then returns how many elements that are greater than or equal to their left neighbour the given array contains!

### Formal parameter list
         
1. `numbers` - the memory address of the array (type: `int *`)
1. `length` - the length of the array (type: `int`)


### Returned value

* the number of elements that are greater than or equal to their left neighbor (type: `int`)

### Examples

| `numbers` | `n` | Returned value | 
| :--- | ---: | ---: | 
| `[89, 41, 99, -14, -90, 4, 85, -32]` | `8` | `3` |
| `[90, -76, 5]` | `3` | `1` |
| `[-63, 35, 65, 76, -30, -63, -40, -4]` | `8` | `5` |
| `[11, 40, 43, -61, 64, -52, -26, 51, -42, 66]` | `10` | `6` |
| `[79]` | `1` | `0` |
| `[-70]` | `1` | `0` |
| `[-84, 47, -26]` | `3` | `1` |
| `[-26, -96, -82, 57, 32]` | `5` | `2` |
| `[27, -35, 12, 25, -58, 40, 43, 76, 57, -4]` | `10` | `5` |

## The `main()` function

Define a `main()` function that lets the user able to execute the solution fulfilling the following requirements:

1. Each test case is described in a single line.
    1. The first integer in the line describes the length of the array (`length`).
    1. The next `length` number of integers are the elements of the array, in their corresponding order.
    1. Integers are separated using simple space (`' '`) characters.
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `3`, at most `10` test cases.
1. The input is terminated with the following line (and it should not be processed):

	```
	0
	```

## Sample execution

### Standard input

```
8 89 41 99 -14 -90 4 85 -32
3 90 -76 5
8 -63 35 65 76 -30 -63 -40 -4
10 11 40 43 -61 64 -52 -26 51 -42 66
1 79
1 -70
3 -84 47 -26
5 -26 -96 -82 57 32
10 27 -35 12 25 -58 40 43 76 57 -4
