# `P105106-n` Removing consonants (version `n` test cases)

## Function `delete_consonants`

Define function `delete_consonants` which returns the string created by removing the English consonants from the original one!

### Formal parameter list

1. `original`: the starting memory address of a string (type: `char *`)

### Returned value

the memory address of the new string (type: `char *`)

### Sample execution

| `original` | Returned value | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"` | `"aeiou"` |
| `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"` | `"AEIOU"` |
| `"0123456789"` | `"0123456789"` |
| `"a·b·c·d·e·f·g·h"` | `"a····e···"` |
| `"aA······bB"` | `"aA······"` |
| `"A··a·····b···B"` | `"A··a········"` |
| `"aB1cD2eF3gH4"` | `"a12e34"` |

Note that each space (`' '`) character of the literals was replaced by a dot (`'·'`) character.

## Function `main()`

Define function `main` which makes the user able to test your solution using the given specification:

1. Each test case is described in a single line (parameter `original`).
    1. Each line can contain at most `100` characters.
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `1` test case.
1. The first line contains the number of test cases (integer `n`). Test cases can be found in the next `n` lines.

## Examples

### Standard input

```

```

### Standard output

```
