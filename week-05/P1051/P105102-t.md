# `P105102-t` Removing lowers (version special value)

## Function `delete_lowers`

Define function `delete_lowers` which returns the string created by removing the lowercase characters from the original one!

### Formal parameter list

1. `original`: the starting memory address of a string (type: `char *`)

### Returned value

the memory address of the new string (type: `char *`)

### Sample execution

| `original` | Returned value | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"` | `""` |
| `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"` | `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"` |
| `"0123456789"` | `"0123456789"` |
| `"a·b·c·d·e·f·g·h"` | `"·······"` |
| `"aA······bB"` | `"A······B"` |
| `"A··a·····b···B"` | `"A··········B"` |
| `"aB1cD2eF3gH4"` | `"B1D2F3H4"` |

Note that each space (`' '`) character of the literals was replaced by a dot (`'·'`) character.

## Function `main()`

Define function `main` which makes the user able to test your solution using the given specification:

1. Each test case is described in a single line (parameter `original`).
    1. Each line can contain at most `100` characters.
1. Call the function for each test case and write the returned value in the following line of the standard output.
1. The input contains at least `1` test case.
1. The input is terminated with the following line (and it should not be processed):

	```
	
	```
