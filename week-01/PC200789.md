# Prime test

Write a program that reads an integer from the standard input and determines whether it is prime.


## Standard input

The input contains a positive integer.

1. Example #1

    ```
    2
    ```

1. Example #2

    ```
    4
    ```

### Standard output

The program prints one line to the output. The line contains character sequence `YES` (`IGEN` in Hungarian) if the integer is a prime number; `NO` (`NEM` in Hungarian) otherwise.

* Example #1:

    ```
    YES
    ```

* Example #2:

    ```
    NO
    ```
