# GCD

Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input. The program should print their greatest common divisor to the standard output.


## Standard input

The input contains two positive integers, separated by a single space.

1. Example #1

    ```
    15 10
    ```

1. Example #2

    ```
    2 7
    ```

### Standard output

The program prints one line to the output, containing the GCD of the integers.

* Example #1:

    ```
    5
    ```

* Example #2:

    ```
    1
    ```
