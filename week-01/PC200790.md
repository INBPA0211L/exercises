# Grading

Write a program that grades the students' tests. A student can get at most `100` points, and the grading scale is the following:

1. `excellent` (`jeles` in Hungarian), if the student gets at least `80` points
1. `good` (`jo` in Hungarian), if the student gets at least `70` points and less than `80` points
1. `satisfactory` (`kozepes` in Hungarian), if the student gets at least `60` points and less than `70` points
2. `pass` (`elegseges` in Hungarian), if the student gets at least `50` points and less than `60` points
3. `fail` (`elegtelen` in Hungarian), if the student gets less than `50` points

## Standard input

1. The first line of the input contains integer `n`, denoting the number of students (`0 <= n <= 100`). Each of the following `n` lines has one integer, a student's score.

    ```
    2
    45
    90
    ```

2. Each line has one integer, a student's score. The end of the input is denoted with `EOF`.

    ```
    45
    90
    ```

3. Each line has one integer, a student's score. The end of the input is denoted with a negative integer (that should not be processed).

    ```
    45
    90
    -1
    ```

### Standard output

The program must print one row to the output, containing the grade of the actual student.

1. English version:

    ```
    fail
    excellent
    ```

1. Hungarian version:

    ```
    elegtelen
    jeles
    ```
