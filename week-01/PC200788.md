# Relative primes

Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input and determines whether they are relative primes.


## Standard input

The input contains two positive integers, separated by a single space.

1. Example #1

    ```
    15 10
    ```

1. Example #2

    ```
    2 7
    ```

### Standard output

The program prints one line to the output. The line contains character sequence `YES` (`IGEN` in Hungarian) if the integers are relative primes; `NO` (`NEM` in Hungarian) otherwise.

* Example #1:

    ```
    NO
    ```

* Example #2:

    ```
    YES
    ```
