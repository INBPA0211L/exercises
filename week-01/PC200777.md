# Arithmetic operands

Write a program that reads integers and operators of the C programming language from the standard input line by line, performs the operation indicated by the operator on the scanned/read values and writes the result to the standard output.

## Standard input

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is a line in the form `x op y`, where `x` and `y` are integers, while `op` is one of the following integer arithmetic operators of the C programming language: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`. The operands are separated from the operator by a space character.

1. The first line of the input contains a positive integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following lines describes a test case. 

    ```
    5
    5 + -5
    165 - -10
    -5 * -2
    23 / 8
    25 % 3
    ```


2. Each line contains one test case. The end of the input is denoted with `EOF`.

    ```
    5 + -5
    165 - -10
    -5 * -2
    23 / 8
    25 % 3
    ```

3. Each line contains one test case. The last line contains at least one zero (`0`) operand. This line should not be processed.

    ```
    5 + -5
    165 - -10
    -5 * -2
    23 / 8
    25 % 3
    6 * 0
    ```

### Standard output

For each test case, the program must write a single line containing the result of the operation `x op y` specified in the test case.

```
0
175
10
2
1
```
